title: About me 
---



My main blog, in Italian, is at [aubreymcfato.com](http://aubreymcfato.com). 
I'm a digital librarian based in Italy, and I'm currently the president of Wikimedia Italia. 

In `books`, you'll find my clippings from books I read on my ereader. All quotes have an header, which is also a link, and represents the ebook locations. The whole site is on GitHub, so you can edit the repo [here](https://github.com/Aubreymcfato/aubreymcfato.github.io). Examples:

* [Invest in toothpicks](http://babele.io/books/2015/08/01/raw-thought.html#8191-8204).     
* [The embedding of markup is a one-way ticket to hell](http://babele.io/books/2015/08/01/possiplex.html#2).
* [The housing crash was not a black swan. The housing crash was the elephant in the room](http://babele.io/books/2015/07/31/signal-and-noise.html#397-98).

In `slides`, you can find, well, slides (proudly made with reveal.js):

* [Costruire comunità](http://babele.io/slides/comunità), marzo 2015. 

in [`aaronswartz`](http://babele.io/aaronswartz/), you can find a tribute ebook about Aaron Swartz. I made this book with Bernardo Parrella and several friends: we selected, translated and edited posts from Aaron and about Aaron. We also selected and wrote few articles regarding open access, hacking and open knowledge.
