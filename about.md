title: About me 
---

My main blog, in Italian, is at [aubreymcfato.com](http://aubreymcfato.com). 
I'm a digital librarian based in Italy, and I'm currently the president of Wikimedia Italia. 

In `books`, you'll find my clippings from books I read on my ereader. All quotes have an header, which is also a link, and represents the ebook locations. The whole site is on GitHub, so you can edit the repo [here](https://github.com/Aubreymcfato/aubreymcfato.github.io).

Examples:

* [Invest in toothpicks](http://babele.io/books/2015/08/01/raw-thought.html#8191-8204).     
* [The embedding of markup is a one-way ticket to hell](http://babele.io/books/2015/08/01/possiplex.html#2).
* [The housing crash was not a black swan. The housing crash was the elephant in the room](http://babele.io/books/2015/07/31/signal-and-noise.html#397-98).
