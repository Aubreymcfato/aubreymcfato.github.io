>But this dream has consistently been deferred, perhaps because it is and has always been wildly unrealistic. The informaticists Rob Kling and Roberta Lamb characterize computing technology as the “centerpiece of seductive dreams,” a license for digital soothsayers to emphasize computing’s utopian potential while ignoring the sociopolitical realities

>Based on the Statute of Anne” is an understatement; as the legal historian Oren Bracha recently noted, “The similarity is felt on every level, including structure, legal technicalities, and specific text.”38 Like the Statute of Anne, the American bill was framed as “an Act for the encouragement of learning,” a matter of public policy instead of as a natural right. Maps, charts, and books were protected under the act, with the term books liberally interpreted to encompass printed works ranging from from catalogs to calendars.39 Authors had to register their works formally with their local district court before copyright was conferred. Many authors did not bother to do so.

>The rhetorical logic of the international copyright debate, through sheer reiteration, led to the development and consecration of the notion of copyright as a property right, and literature as property. And the people who controlled that property resolved to protect it.

>The number of free public libraries in America grew prodigiously in the 1890s and 1900s, precipitated by grants and donations from rich men, such as the industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who hoped to whitewash their fortunes by erecting “a brown-stone buildin’ in ivry town in the country with me name over it,” as the columnist Finley Peter Dunne wrote in the voice of his Mr. Dooley character

>“In creating and training such a cadre, corporate capitalists created a virtually new social class, one that Marx had not anticipated.”9 These administrators’ livelihoods were supported by proprietary media, yet they were rarely creators themselves. Their rise to prominence was inevitable. As Christopher P. Wilson put it, this was an era when literature “could be conceived as a product of labor rather than romantic inspiration.”10 The product of labor is property. Information wants to be expensive.
 But the rise of the

>copyright terms should be long and easily renewable; scofflaws should face civil or criminal penalties; the public benefit in copyright was identical to the author’s benefit; and those who felt differently were probably pirates.

>Vannevar rhymes with believer, and when it came to government funding of scientific research, Bush certainly was. He was also a lifelong believer in libraries, and the benefits to be derived from their automation. In 1945, he published an article in the Atlantic Monthly that proposed a rudimentary mechanized library called Memex, a linked-information retrieval system. Memex was a desk-size machine that was equal parts stenographer, filing cabinet, and reference librarian: “a device in which an individual stores his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.”49

>Bush maintained that computerized libraries would transform society, and that Project Intrex would “influence, perhaps revolutionize, the methods of every professional group—in law, medicine, the humanities. It will support every phase of our general culture. I believe very few scholars today realize what this could mean. I am sure the general public does not realize, for instance, that success in this program could mean as much to their well-being, their health, as has been produced by the power of antibiotics.”50 Even the most pragmatic men couldn’t help but sound idealistic when it came to libraries and their potential to change the world

> Worst of all, pirates use violence to help themselves to other people’s property. The term pirate groups copyright infringers in the same category as Blackbeard, Captains Kidd and Hook, and other notorious maritime villains. It’s hard to recover from that initial mental association, from the image of rogue bands of printers, tape dubbers, and photoduplicatrixes roaming the oceans of copyright, ruthlessly plundering innocents for their personal gain

>To resolve the dispute between composers and the infernal-talking-machine proprietors, the 1909 framers created a public-performance clause, wherein composers were compensated if their works were exhibited in public

>The photocopier, like the jukebox, inspired fear and loathing among members of the copyright committee. Though mechanized document-duplication devices had existed since the 1920s, the invention in 1959 of the one-piece photocopier, or Xerox machine, made photoduplication a veritable pleasure rather than a rage-inducing chore. Now, with minimal effort, anyone could duplicate any bit of printed content he or she desired. Much of the discussion during the meetings was devoted to strategies for

>distinction between a fact and an artifact.61 A fact is one of “nature’s creations,” an ownerless piece of knowledge or data that belongs to the public. The periodic table, for example, is a fact: the tabular relationship between the chemical elements belongs to no one person, but instead is common knowledge on which all are free to draw and build. An artifact is a proprietary derivative of a fact: a specific and unique expression of fact or fancy. A colorful, uniquely designed poster of

>Another useful concept when attempting to understand the various points of view on copyright and intellectual property issues is the difference between gift economies and market economies. In a gift economy, a person gains influence and stature by the skill with which he gives and receives gifts; the gift, which is freely given with no expectation of recompense or tangible reward, is the primary medium of exchange

>Nonacademic work, however, exists in a market economy, where cultural artifacts are bought and sold, and the creator benefits by reaping financial reward from the sale of his work. The creator is not giving gifts to the public: he is, rather, selling goods to the public, and he needs the money because, unlike his professorial counterparts, his salary is generally not underwritten by a large, benevolent institution.

 As for Project Intrex, it faced a dearth of let’s-do and, ultimately, never came together. “The project seemed to be a bottomless financial pit,” wrote the historian Colin Burke, perhaps the world’s foremost Intrex authority.63 Burke also noted that the “technology was not ready to provide the high-powered information engine their goals demanded. Those that put too much faith in rapid technological advances, like Intrex, had to spend too much time waiting for the technology to appear

>Hart traveled to his own beat as a matter of principle. A basic problem with society, in Hart’s estimation, was that too many of its citizens were stuck in their own silos, accepting received wisdom as dogma, unwilling or unable to think for themselves. Hart hadn’t had much success convincing others to open their minds, however, and he wondered if his window of opportunity was closing. “At the end of the 60’s the Age of Apathy began and I started losing interest in my audiences because ther [sic] were losing interest in everything,” he wrote, explaining why he had abandoned his musical ambitions.17

>To him, the progression seemed obvious. You couldn’t change the world without changing minds, and you couldn’t transform people’s thought processes without giving them something new to think about. The powerful wanted to keep the masses ignorant and pliable by making information expensive and scarce. Hart concluded that digital networks could be used to set that data free.

>For Michael Hart, the digitization of public-domain literature was a vocation in its original sense: a spiritual calling to a movement. But movements need names, and Hart delayed for a long while—for seventeen years following his transcription of the Declaration of Independence, to be exact—before choosing one. Lying on a mattress on the floor of his house in Urbana, Illinois, in 1988,36 Hart pondered various names for his endeavor—The Electronic Book Factory, The Never Ending Library, Library Galactica37—before finally adopting one that elegantly captured both his own revolutionary ambition and his endeavor’s transformative potential: Project Gutenberg

>If libraries nurtured dreamers like Michael Hart, then digital computers and networks activated them. “When I first learned I had access to the Internet back in 1971 it was as if one of those lights you see in the comics went off with a flash right over my head,” Hart recalled.39 Generations of disaffected nerds have felt the same way. The real world favors the handsome and coordinated, rewards conformism and compliance, and reinforces systemic inequities by design. The Internet offers an alternative

>“The idea on which Lick’s worldview pivoted,” according to Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon in Where Wizards Stay Up Late, “was that technological progress would save humanity.”41 Machines’ storage, retrieval, and processing capabilities would help their human operators to be more productive by minimizing error and mundane repetition. Humans would, in turn, improve and refine the machines.

>Thus these early users, prohibited from exploiting the network for profit, used it instead to foster the free exchange of information.
 This munificent ideology was encoded into what the author Steven Levy described in his insightful book Hackers as the “hacker ethic.” Hackers—a term for early computer programmers—wrote computer code and believed that other hackers should share their code and computing resources with their peers

>Though Hart and Stallman worked in different fields, they shared similar tools, goals, and methods. They also shared similar blind spots. Free software and free literature by themselves will not necessarily improve society, and proprietary books and computer programs will not necessarily destroy it. The rise of a commercial trade around cultural artifacts can also end up expanding the audience for those artifacts, exposing them to people who might never have known they existed.

>The gargantuan mainframes of the 1960s had given way to smaller computers suitable to the home office, produced and marketed by entrepreneurs who realized the potential for consumer revenue. Microsoft’s Bill Gates—whose MS-DOS and Windows operating systems eventually dominated the PC market—and Apple’s Steve Jobs, for instance, were unmoved by the hackers’ utopian rhetoric. They wanted to make money, not save the world

>A source of much debate over recent years has been whether to write software in-house or buy it from commercial suppliers. Now, a third alternative is becoming significant in what some see as a revolution in software supply,” he wrote, referring to the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project. Berners-Lee wondered whether Stallman’s ideas might not be applied to the work he was doing for CERN. “Just as we publish physics for free, should we not in certain cases ‘publish’ our software?” he asked.61

>Though the World Wide Web is often used as a synonym for the Internet, they are not the same thing. The “information superhighway” metaphor may be hoary, but it still has its uses. A highway is just a road, designed to carry all sorts of vehicles without discrimination. Automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, trailers—they all use the highway, and the highway doesn’t favor one over another. The road is simply infrastructure. You can think of the Internet as a highway that is used by different programs. Your e-mail service is one of them. Instant-messaging applications are another. The World Wide Web is just another of these programs

>The Web became popular because of its linking capacity. In his proposal for Memex, Vannevar Bush advanced the idea that the associative trails between two disparate thoughts or facts could be captured and stored. The Web put a version of this idea into practice by allowing its users to link directly to other documents or websites: a feature called hypertext. The World Wide Web was modeled after an actual web, composed of threads—hypertext links—that spun out in all directions, connecting various far-flung nodes, or websites.

>Despite the existence of initiatives such as Project Gutenberg, despite the emergence of the Internet as a new medium for information retrieval and distribution, the same official attitudes about intellectual property prevailed. The public domain was regarded as a penalty rather than as an opportunity. Parochial concerns were conflated with the public interest. The rise of the Internet might portend an informational revolution, but from the standpoint of the people in power, Hart warned, revolution was a bad thing.

>The law was called the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), in honor of the recently deceased congressman and songwriter. Bono’s widow, Representative Mary Bono, claimed that her husband had “wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever,” and his former colleagues in Congress basically decided to grant his wish.9 The CTEA extended the copyright term on any given work created before 1978 to ninety-five years after its first publication. Works published after 1977 would remain under copyright until seventy years after the author’s death.

>Lawrence “Larry” Lessig was a law professor at Harvard University, where he was affiliated with the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society. Though he had come to lead a movement looking to liberalize America’s copyright laws, he didn’t immediately seem like a particularly radical fellow. Lessig “grew up a right-wing lunatic Republican” and had clerked for the conservative jurists Richard Posner and Antonin Scalia.20

 The solution was a series of “licenses” that allowed creators to grant preemptive permission to people who wished to use and distribute their work. A photographer could publish one of her photographs under a Creative Commons “attribution” license, for example, which meant that anyone was free to copy, distribute, and display the photograph as long as they credited the photographer for her work.

 Although the word has many political associations, Merton’s term communism simply meant that the products of scientific research belong to the community, and that scientists are rewarded for their discoveries not by money, but by “recognition and esteem.” Isaac Newton was the first to describe his second law of motion, for instance, but that fact does not entitle his descendants to royalties whenever an object comes to rest and stays at rest.

>Scientific discoveries “constitute a common heritage in which the equity of the individual producer is severely limited,” wrote Merton. “Property rights in science are whittled down to a bare minimum by the rationale of the scientific ethic.”58
 Merton further noted the absolute incompatibility of the communal scientific ethos with “the definition of technology as ‘private property’ in a capitalistic economy.”59 As capitalism and academic science continued to coalesce in the twentieth century, this communal ethos was put at risk.
