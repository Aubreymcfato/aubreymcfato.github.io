>It is no coincidence that the most destructive and the most constructive of human inventions appeared at exactly the same time. Only the collective intelligence of computers could save us from the destructive powers of the weapons they had allowed us to invent.

>Turing’s underlying interest in the “decision problem” is easily overlooked. In answering the Entscheidungsproblem, Turing proved that there is no systematic way to tell, by looking at a code, what that code will do. That’s what makes the digital universe so interesting, and that’s what brings us here.

>Perhaps the consciousness of animals is more shadowy than ours and perhaps their perceptions are always dreamlike,” physicist Eugene Wigner recalled in 1964. “On the opposite side, whenever I talked with von Neumann, I always had the impression that only he was fully awake.”

>According to Leibniz, relation gave rise to substance, not, as Newton had it, the other way around. “Back to Leibniz!” is how Norbert Wiener titled an article on quantum mechanics in 1932. “I can see no essential difference between the materialism which includes soul as a complicated type of material particle and a spiritualism which includes material particles as a primitive type of soul,” Wiener added in 1934.43

> 6J6 tubes, twenty in each bank, for a total of eighty tubes, were installed in a test rack so they were oriented up, down, and in the two horizontal positions (cathode edge-wise and cathode flat). The entire rack was mounted on a vibrating aluminum plate, and the tubes left to run for three thousand hours. “A total of six failed, four within the first few hours, one about 3 days and one after 10 days,” was the final report. “There were four heater failures, one grid short and one seal failure.”62
The problem wasn’t tubes that failed completely—built-in self-diagnostic routines made these easy to identify and replace—it was tubes that either were not up to specification in the first place, or that drifted off specification with age. How could you count on getting correct results? While von Neumann was beginning to formulate, from the top down, the ideas that would develop into his 1951 “Reliable Organizations of Unreliable Elements” and 1952 “Probabilistic Logics and the Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components,” the technicians at the Institute were facing the same problem, from the bottom up.
It took an engineer fluent in wartime electronics and wartime ingenuity to solve the problem of building a reliable computer from unreliable war surplus parts. Jack Rosenberg, from New Brunswick, New Jersey, was the first in his family to attend college, entering MIT in 1934 at age sixteen. As a senior in high school he had attended the Century of Progress exhibit in Chicago, and “spent nearly the whole week in what was called the Hall of Science. And I saw there a booth by MIT, and I talked to the man at the booth, and he said MIT is probably the toughest school to get into. So I applied to MIT.”
Rosenberg started out in mathematics but switched to electrical engineering, graduating at the top of his class with two degrees. “When I went around for interviews in 1939, I saw many of my classmates already working,” he says. “I knew that I was more intelligent than them, but that’s the way it went.” So he took a job as a civilian engineer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, becoming an officer when the United States joined the war.
July of 1945 found Rosenberg on board an army troop ship sailing at eight knots across the Pacific to the Philippines, to prepare for the invasion of Japan. “As a radio ham, I spent most of my waking time in the radio room listening to the short wave,” he says. Since the slow transport was a sitting duck, transmission was not allowed. On August 6, 1945, he heard news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, followed by news of the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9. “The ship’s troop commander was as startled as I had been,” he says. “He told me to keep listening to the radio. His orders for the invasion had not been changed.” Then the news of Japan’s unconditional surrender arrived. “The bombs had saved our lives,” says Rosenberg, and however difficult von Neumann (and Oppenheimer) proved to be as his employers, he never forgot that.63
Rosenberg remained in the southern Philippines until April 1946. In the post exchange, he found a copy of Atomic Energy for Military Purposes, a swiftly declassified nontechnical account of the Manhattan Project by Henry Smyth, chairman of the physics department at Princeton University. Upon his discharge from the army, at Fort Dix, New Jersey, in July of 1946—having returned across the Pacific on a turbine-driven steamship at thirty knots—Rosenberg went to Princeton to seek a job in nuclear energy research. He was hired by the Physics Department to work on the instrumentation for the university’s new cyclotron, but, he says, “my enthusiasm lasted about a month.”
“Early in 1947,” he continues, “I was informed that at the Institute for Advanced Study, a famous scientist was looking for an engineer to develop an electronic machine of a sort no one but he understood.” Rosenberg interviewed with Bigelow and von Neumann, and started work in July. “There was a lot of anti-Semitism in the army. But there wasn’t anti-Semitism with Johnny,” he says.
“Johnny used to meet with each of us individually about once a week, asking what we had built, how it worked, what problems we had, what symptoms we observed, what causes we had diagnosed,” says Rosenberg. “Each question was precisely the best one based on the information he had uncovered so far. His logic was faultless—he never asked a question that was irrelevant or erroneous. His questions came in rapid-fire order, revealing a mind that was lightning-fast and error-free. In about an hour he led each of us to understand what we had done, what we had encountered, and where to search for the problem’s cause. It was like looking into a very accurate mirror with all unnecessary images eliminated, only the important details left.”

>Von Neumann appended a cover letter, adding that “the mathematical problem of predicting weather is one which can be tackled, and should be tackled, since the most conspicuous meteorological phenomena originate in unstable or metastable situations which could be controlled, or at least directed, by the release of perfectly practical amounts of energy.”22

>practical method than ‘abstract thinking’ might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays.” This, he noted, was a far easier way to arrive at an approximate answer than “to try to compute all the combinatorial possibilities which are an exponentially increasing number so great that, except in very elementary cases, there is no way to estimate it.”46

>Instead of tabulating the statistics of human populations, Klári was tabulating the statistics of populations of neutrons, as they underwent scattering (equivalent to travel), fission (equivalent to reproduction), escape (equivalent to emigration), or absorption (equivalent to death). By following enough generations, it was possible to determine whether a given configuration would go critical or not. Klári could hardly have better prepared herself for bomb design than by her apprenticeship at the Office of Population Research.

>Ulam began imagining how, in a one-dimensional universe, cosmology might evolve. “Has anybody considered the following problem—which appears to me very pretty,” he wrote to von Neumann in February 1949. “Imagine that on the infinite line –∞ to +∞ I have occupied the integer points each with probability say ½ by material point masses—i.e. I have this situation,” and he sketched a random distribution of points on a line. “This is a distribution at time t=0.”

>We now know that lateral gene transfer and other non-neo-Darwinian mechanisms are far more prevalent, especially in microbiology, than was evident in 1953.
“If, instead of using living organisms, one could experiment with entities which, without any doubt could evolve exclusively by ‘mutations’ and selection,” Barricelli argued, “then and only then would a successful evolution experiment give conclusive evidence;

>Are they the beginning of, or some sort of, foreign life forms? Are they only models?” he asked. “They are not models, not any more than living organisms are models. They are a particular class of self-reproducing structures already defined.” As to whether they are living, “it does not make sense to ask whether symbioorganisms are living as long as no clear-cut definition of ‘living’ has been given.”40 A clear-cut definition of “living” remains elusive to this day.

> They learned how to divide into packets, traverse the network, correct any errors suffered along the way, and reassemble themselves at the other end. By representing music, images, voice, knowledge, friendship, status, money, and sex—the things people value most—they secured unlimited resources, forming complex metazoan organisms running on a multitude of individual processors the way a genome runs on a multitude of cells.

>If humans, instead of transmitting to each other reprints and complicated explanations, developed the habit of transmitting computer programs allowing a computer-directed factory to construct the machine needed for a particular purpose, that would be the closest analogue to the communication methods among cells.”45 Twenty-five years later, much of the communication between computers is not passive data, but active instructions to construct specific machines, as needed, on the remote host.

One reason is to facilitate the acquisition of new, useful genes that would otherwise remain the property of someone else. “The power of horizontal gene transfer is so great that it is a major puzzle to understand why it would be that the eukaryotic world would turn its back on such a wonderful source of genetic novelty and innovation,”

> you examined the structure of a computer, “you could not possibly tell what it is doing at any moment,” Bigelow explained. “The importance of structure to how logical processes take place is beginning to diminish as the complexity of the logical process increases.” Bigelow then pointed out that the significance of Turing’s 1936 result was “to show in a very important, suggestive way how trivial structure really is.”36 Structure can always be replaced by code.

>In a digital computer, the instructions are in the form of COMMAND (ADDRESS) where the address is an exact (either absolute or relative) memory location, a process that translates informally into “DO THIS with what you find HERE and go THERE with the result.” Everything depends not only on precise instructions, but also on HERE, THERE, and WHEN being exactly defined.
In biology, the instructions say, “DO THIS with the next copy of THAT which comes along.”

>Over long distances, it is expensive to transport structures, and inexpensive to transmit sequences. Turing machines, which by definition are structures that can be encoded as sequences, are already propagating themselves, locally, at the speed of light. The notion that one particular computer resides in one particular location at one time is obsolete.
If life, by some chance, happens to have originated, and survived, elsewhere in the universe, it will have had time to explore an unfathomable diversity of forms.

There was a long, drawn-out pause. “Look,” Teller finally said, lowering his voice to a raspy whisper, “may I suggest that instead of explaining this, which would be hard … you write a science-fiction book about it.”
“Probably someone has,” I said.
“Probably,” answered Teller, “someone has not.”

> was all of it a large system of on and off, binary gates,” Bigelow reiterated fifty years later. “No clocks. You don’t need clocks. You only need counters. There’s a difference between a counter and a clock. A clock keeps track of time. A modern general purpose computer keeps track of events.”15 This distinction separates the digital universe from our universe, and is one of the few distinctions left.

>Among the computers populating this network, most processing cycles are going to waste. Most processors, most of the time, are waiting for instructions. Even within an active processor, as Bigelow explained, most computational elements are waiting around for something to do next. The global computer, for all its powers, is perhaps the least efficient machine that humans have ever built. There is a thin veneer of instructions, and then there is a dark, empty 99.9 percent.
