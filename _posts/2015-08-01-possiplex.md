When you are supposed to be concentrating on one thing, a different idea—especially if it is fascinating—gets in the way of the agenda. But suppose you don’t care about their agenda?

>Fuzzy shapes passed underneath. I studied the water's crystal softness. The water was opening around my fingers, gently passing around them, then closing again behind. I considered the different places in the water and the connections between them, the places that at one instant were next to each other, then separated as my fingers passed. They rejoined, but no longer in the same way. How is it, I wondered, that every instant's arrangement, in the water and the world, can be so much the same as just before, and yet so different? How could even the best words express this complexity? How could even the best words express what systems of relationships were the same and different? And how many relationships were there? I could not have said "relationships" or "systems" then, let alone “particles” or “manifolds” or "higher-level commonalities," but those were my exact concerns. My

>The insight was sound. Profuse connection is the whole problem of abstraction, perception and thought. Profuse connection is the whole problem of expression, of saying anything. It is the problem of writing. It is the problem of seeing-- we see and imagine so much more than we can express. Trying to communicate ideas requires selection from this vast, ever-expanding net. Writing on paper is a hopeless reduction, as it means throwing out most of the connections, telling the reader only the smallest part in one particular sequence. And this is what I have hoped to fix, or at least improve, through most of my life, giving the world a greater and better way to express thoughts and ideas. And that is what this book is about.

>The standard silly game theory, beloved of economists, assumes two perfect adversaries—what one wins the other loses—and no communication. This perfect rivalry is perfectly asinine, as Schelling demonstrated in his examples and tables, though he was much more polite about it. Real-life situations are always mixed; adversaries almost always have interests in common. Thus the most important things about conflict, said Schelling, are often the areas of mutual interest, and how adversaries communicate in real-life situations.

>Bales made the most trenchant remark on computers I ever heard. ‘The computer is the greatest projective system* ever created’, Bales said to me. Meaning that anyone looking at the computer would think they were seeing reality, but would see something projected from their own mind. *A projective system is something which, like a Rorschach test, invites people to project on it their own personalities and ideas, often unwittingly. For fifty years since then, I have marveled at how everyone projects onto the computer their own issues and concerns and personality. I did too.

>The idea of “the paperless office” is widely derided and called an impossible myth. I totally disagree: it’s entirely possible. But paperlessness is impossible the way they’re thinking of it.

>A fundamental idea came to me this way. For three years I had been keeping notes on file cards, and I already had a terrible problem with these notes. Many of my file cards belonged in several places at once— several different sequences or projects. Each card—call it now an entry or an item--*should be stored only once. Then each project or sequence would be a list of those items. Each entry would seem to be in each of its different projects, but it would only exist in one place, and the lists would point to it. * Or in Doug Engelbart’s terminology, a statement.

>This concept is now called transclusion., referring to-- - re-use by pointer - the same thing in many contexts, with access to the original - content re-use with path back to the original It is fundamental to my work. But we’ve gone through so many words for it, trying to get the idea across— • quote-window • transquotation •• various others I can’t remember right now, and worst of all, • equolateration. The present definition: content re-use with path back to the original. It has many uses. No conventional document systems (like Microsoft Word or the Web) will support transclusion.* * di Iorio and Lumley have done an excellent technical analysis of alternative methods of transclusion for the World Wide Web, and why they don’t work. See Angelo Di Iorio and John Lumley, "From XML Inclusions to XML Transclusions," Proceedings of the Hypertext 2009 conference, ACM.

>• first I wanted to have the same file cards in multiple sets. Each of these sets would be represented internally as a list of pointers. • second, this would make the content safe—if you store it and leave it alone. • then, it was the idea that you could compare sets of file cards side by side to see which ones were in both sets. • then came the idea of fine-grain editing by pointer. • this meant full text documents could be compared side by side, to see what contents they shared (transclusion).

>what I actually did was to separate the content from the structure. This allowed a couple of really neat things, including: • The text was always intact, allowing easy processing by things like compilers, spell checkers, mail, and anything requiring clear text. • A document with a corrupted structure (remember how that happened?) was relatively easy to repair. • The same document could have multiple, different structures. • One was not bound to a single, hierarchical tree structure. You could slice it and dice it anyway you want. • It took much less space and processing to store and manipulate a document this way (this was once important.) The editor which I wrote originally ran on a Data General Nova in 8 KB (that's 8,000 BYTES), was lightning fast (complete screen refresh in well under 1/2 sec), and supported all of the entities used by NLS (statement, branch, plex, group, etc.) yet allowed there to be missing 'pieces' in the hierarchy, i.e. there could be missing branches on the tree. It also supported links, words, visibles, the keyset, and the mouse. It had a useful life of over 20 years (it was ported several times and eventually ended up on the Alto, courtesy of Smokey Wallace, where it was called UGH (Uncomonly Good Hack). There were not extensive text formatting features (mostly due to the state of the art at the time.)

>We would be freeing both reader and author. The author would not have to choose among alternative organizations; the reader could do that, choosing among the author’s different organizations and perhaps adding his own. (What system of order would allow this was still not clear.) We could also free up the educational system. If readers could choose their own paths through a subject, they would be far more interested (as had been my own college experience, skimming and flipping excitedly rather than slogging sequentially). The educational system could still have tests and strong criteria of learning; but we could give the student freedom to choose the means and style of learning a subject. This would be a very powerful motivator. (It had been for me.) Unfortunately, pre-college education as we know it (and inflict it) is a bureaucratic system for fulfilling lists-- scheduling seats, classrooms, student movements, teacher movements, and tests. It is intrinsically and deeply hostile to what I am talking about here.

>ome, like a certain vicious journalist, have implied that I could not have known in 1960 that a world-wide electronic publishing system of interconnected documents could ever be possible.

>The question was how to transpose copyright to this new world of on-line electronic documents, and whether this transposition would be beneficial and benign, or ugly and clumsy and forbidding. A micropayment system would be needed— not just for whole documents, but for little pieces of documents. Why should you have to pay for a whole document—especially since documents might go on forever, since there were no space restrictions?

## <a name="57">[57](#57)</a>
>* Note: Tim Berners-Lee said I proposed a link to every quotation (see 1999). That would be impossible and just as ridiculous as he seems to think. The way to do it is through transclusion of the quoted content, so it is delivered to the user from the original and the transaction of paying for the quotation is with the server of the original document. This would settle the issues of permissions, and plagiarism, and context, all in one fell swoop. (And since you’d be able to look from any quote to its origin, nothing would be out of context—in this new sense of ‘context’ being another document zooming up* next to the quotation.)

Pag. 113.

## <a name="58">[58](#58)</a>
>HERE IS THE POINT: by this system, all content could be made easily re-usable with complete fairness. Everything would be paid for to its source publisher, and it would all add up correctly if each user’s system buys each tiny portion as delivered from wherever. Moreover, the original context of quotation would be available immediately, clarifying issues of • author’s meaning and surrounding issues • credit and “moral right” (a term I did not know at the time) • plagiarism— indeed, extensive offhand quotation would become legitimate Conventional publishers would not have to join this system—they might resist it at first— but soon they would want to. The elegance, clarity and power of this vision have driven me to continue fighting for it for the last fifty years. I later coined the word “micropayment” for the miniscule payments I foresaw. Purchases of thousandths of a cent, or less, should be possible; I have been aghast to see people recently use the term “micropayment” for payments over a cent, even up to a dollar.

>Almost every living document needs repeated revision. Indeed, the tradition of completion in publishing is fundamentally based on two things-- • the nature of the printing press and print runs, which all have to be the same; • the nation of canonical versions in literary analysis. In this structure, the canonical version can be the whole docuplex of versions.

>All content would be • reusable • linkable • annotatable I foresaw a client-server system, though the term did not exist then. Content would stay on the servers and appear on the screens; it would not be downloaded to the user. (The terms “upload” and “download” did not exist then either.) If a user purchased content—in any amount, even a sentence-- it would stay on the server, but now that sentence would be registered as belonging to him, so he would not have to purchase it again. If a user bought part of a document, a table would be created for that user of exactly what parts of it he owned and could re-access at any time.* * This was implicitly the design from 1960-1, though I’m not sure when it became this definite. But because everything in the system could be rearranged and recomposited by pointer—the awful term ‘mashup’ did not then exist—you could re-use anything once you owned it! This is because you could include it in your own document, as a pointer to whatever original you knew about it. (You could, in principle, also re-use original content you didn’t know about, but how could you point at it?)

>As soon as you have a curriculum, some people are “ahead” and some people are “behind,” and nobody can slow down to enjoy the parts they like or speed over what they understand already. As long as there is a fixed schedule and path of learning, education cannot be improved. Having to do things in one sequence, with no variation for personal interests, is what makes school horrible. Now, in our new document world, we would fix that.

>have generally had absolute confidence about the way my designs would feel, and I have generally been right. Indeed, I have designed backward from the feel I wanted to achieve. According to conventional wisdom, this is impossible. They say that you can’t know what software (or an interface) will be like until you try it. Ah, but you see, there are people with special talents. My favorite example is this: Hitchcock did not look through the lens. He knew how a shot would look, from a certain angle and with a lens of his choice, without having to look. (I have not heard this about any other film director.) It has been the same with my software. Shaping the design in my mind (sometimes wiggling my fingers on an imaginary keyboard), I can imagine each variant and what it will do to the feel. This is not to say I can imagine other people’s designs from a description; only that I can work out the feel of my own in advance.

We cooked by rotation, announcing the menu; you could invite as many people as you like, the cook would buy enough groceries on the day for everyone signed up, and you would be billed according to the number of your guests in the kitchen accounting. This facilitated many happy dinner parties with people from all over. (You could also snack freely-- in the sense of free speech--, billing yourself for the value of whatever you ate, provided you did not snack from the planned dinner provisions.)

>or all too short a time I had an illustrious office-mate named Gregory Bateson. Famed anthropologist and psychological theorist, he was exceptionally warm and pleasant. He smoked his cigarettes to very short stubs and swore frequently but charmingly in a way that American academics did not, in those days. “Oh, fuck! Fuck and damn!” he would say, most charmingly. His very wrinkled face may have had to do with the smoking. He and the Lillys once came to dinner our over-garage apartment (by this time I was married). I wish I had known how little time I had with him. We had only a couple of conversations. I once spoke of Margaret Mead, his ex-wife—“Oh, Margaret!” I remember him saying, with great enthusiasm for her.

>Bateson and I talked about words: I think we talked about the famous phrase Bateson had coined, “double bind”. He told me his father had also coined an interesting word: “metamerism”, meaning the biological multiplication of successful units, such as the segments of a millipede or centipede, or the scales of a fish. (Bateson did not mention that his father also coined the word “genetics”.) I wanted to talk to Bateson about my interest in social strategics, and I spoke very carefully because I venerated him so. ‘It seems to me,’ I said, ‘that greeting behavior is essentially a gateway procedure that changes the context of an encounter into a different social state.’ “Of course,” said Gregory Bateson. I think he left CRI shortly after that, and I had no further chance to talk to him, which I greatly regretted.* *There is a footnote. The famous phrase “A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle” originated with my great friend Charlie Harris. It started as “a man without faith is like a fish without a bicycle”, and I put it in one of my musicals at Swarthmore. Charlie has traced the history of the phrase after that; apparently the line went from Bateson to Herb Caen to Gloria Steinem, who switched it to “a woman without a man.” I think it will have been I that passed the phrase to Bateson, as a link in that immortal chain.

It accomplishes the first 15% of hypertext and rules out the rest. I have wasted the last 15 years of my life trying to temporize with HTML. I am not saying I will never under any circumstances work with HTML again, but rather that I will go to the ends of the earth to try every alternative first. For much of the 1990s, I tried to figure out what I believed in using Web formats and HTML. We did a number of demonstration projects, such as HyperTransaction at Keio. But there’s no real way.

For example, if you were reading this book in hypertext, you would be able to follow a link from my reference to Xanadu to further details of that project. In Ted's vision, every quotation would have been a link8 back to its source, allowing original authors9 to be compensated by a very small amount each time the quotation was read10. He had the dream of a utopian11 society in which all information could be shared among people who communicated as equals.12 He struggled for years to find funding for his project, but success eluded him.”

I was in plays from first grade or kindergarten, I believe, and in plays it was made clear that the director was in charge. I accepted this because it was for the good of the show. Any director was better than no director; without coordination the show would be a sprawling mess. Readers may be tempted to an Oedipal interpretation here, seeing that my father became a director when I was nine or ten. However, I had come to believe in theatrical directors much earlier. I had been in plays since I was four or five, and a rather knowing moviegoer soon after, and it became clear to me as a boy that someone has to be in charge of a theatrical production or movie.* Watching my father work later simply confirmed this view.
